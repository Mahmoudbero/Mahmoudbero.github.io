    <h1>Thank you DCI Team</h1>
    <p>Dear DCI Team, I'd like to thank you for the great opportunity which you offered me. <br>This means a lot to me and I believe that it will change my life for ever. <br>Before joining the DCI family, coding and programming were a strange words for
        me. Today and after just one month, <br>I am able to create a website from scratch. I am looking forward to completing the course. <br>Thank you for your great support and efforts. <br><br><br>Mahmoud Albaradan</p>
